## Project Description

## Project Description:
The project, **"Healthcare Blood Donation System Using AI,"** aims to address inefficiencies in current blood donation systems by creating a centralized, AI-powered platform. The system facilitates real-time donor matching based on blood type, location, and urgency. It bridges communication gaps between donors and healthcare providers, improving the speed and coordination of blood donations.

## Problem Statement:
- **Inefficient System:** Existing systems lack a centralized platform, making it challenging to locate suitable donors in critical situations.
- **Healthcare Impact:** This inefficiency leads to delays in sourcing blood, which can result in life-threatening outcomes.
- **Donor Challenges:** The absence of a unified platform discourages potential donors from actively participating in the donation process.

## Solution Overview:
- **Donor Module:** Allows registration, medical details input, and AI-based availability predictions.
- **AI Matching Engine:** Filters donors by blood type, location, and urgency.
- **Healthcare Provider Dashboard:** Enables institutions to request blood and view real-time donor matches.
- **Notification Module:** Sends alerts to donors and healthcare providers via SMS, email, or push notifications.
- **Database:** Secure storage of donor and healthcare data.
